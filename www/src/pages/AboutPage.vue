      What if neighbourhoods were designed so that people could live sustainability with minimal effort? What can
      Aotearoa New Zealand learn from successful models both here and worldwide? To increase understanding of the
      relationship between urban form and emissions, this online mapping tool helps with visualisation of transport
      patterns and emissions. This tool is designed for a laptop or desktop machine, rather than a mobile device.

    <h2>About the Visualisation</h2>
    <p>
      The tool itself currently has two key views: one is the emissions scenario visualisation; the other is the trends
      in travel mode. There are several tabs; Auckland, Christchurch, Wellington, and Oamaru which show the patterns for
      both emissions and transport in these places.
    </p>
    <h2>About the Emission Scenario Controller</h2>
    <p>
      The ‘emissions’ tab allows us to visualise how emissions change the overall flows of vehicles for each of the
      areas listed above. We can do this using the ‘Scenario Controller’. The baseline data is automatically loaded into
      the visualisation in the background map. Select any category to determine how shifts in the fuel type of vehicles
      will shift the CO2 footprint of the area of interest. In the example below we shift Hybrid to make up ¾ of the
      vehicle fleet and show that there would be a 44.91% reduction in total carbon emissions even with the same VKT

    <h2>About the Mode Share Visualiser</h2>
    <p>
      The mode share tab visualises the transport patterns from the 2018 census for each of the cities and localities
      listed above. There are active transport (e.g. Walking and Cycling), public transport (e.g. bus), Drive, Passenger
      and other categories to select to help you understand the most recent travel trends in the region of interest. The
      data is focused on travel to work. There is a box in the top right-hand corner of the window to allow users to
      query the origin and destination data of where residents have come from and to work. Once an area is selected
      (e.g. Christchurch Central), it is possible to query Incoming, Outgoing or internal commuters for that area.
      Selecting
      a particular area, by clicking on any of the circles, will display the trip data. For example, 6,825 incoming
      commuters, 9 outgoing and 18 internal commuters for Christchurch Central.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: it is this data that has formed the basis of the ‘mode shift’ scenarios developed as part of the project.

    <h2>About the Carbon Neutral Neighbourhood team</h2>
    <p>
      The Carbon Neutral Neighbourhood project is led by an interdisciplinary team at
      <span class="text-nowrap">Te Whare Wānanga o Waitaha |University of Canterbury.</span>
      The team has analysed international examples of well-functioning cities, towns and neighbourhoods that have low
      greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We have put all these case studies together into digestible reports. See link
      here:
      <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4410167">https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4410167</a>
      By providing accessible and actionable lessons, this knowledge will support planners to meet GHG emissions
      reduction goals. It aims to enable developing and retrofitting more sustainable, healthy, accessible, and
      resilient cities, towns and neighbourhoods across Aotearoa New Zealand.
